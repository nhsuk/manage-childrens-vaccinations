# Introduction and Goals

Provide a service to record childrens vaccinations in settings encountered by
SAIS staff.

## Requirements Overview

In addition to allowing SAIS staff to record vaccinations efficiently, the
service is designed to integrate with a central vaccination record, and in
certain settings provide the service while offline.

This service is part of the alpha phase to explore the user needs of such a
service; to facilitate this, it is being developed with a priority on speed of
delivery and flexbility over robustness and longevity, and as such may be
considered disposable once the desired learnings have been achieved.

## Quality Goals

As this service is in alpha stages, the current emphasis of this pilot is speed
of development and flexibility to adapt to the service design as it changes and
adapts to new research.
