# 3. Use a design system

**Date:** 2022-10-31
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The service will need a consistent visual design.

The [NHS.UK Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) has a distinct visual design that is used by other NHS services.

## Decision

We've settled on the GOV.UK Design System, because it's the standard for accessible and performant services, and a requirement for passing a service assessment.

Spike: We’ll customise it to look like the [NHS.UK Design System](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system).

## Consequences

- We’ll need to build tooling/libraries/integrations with the existing design system
