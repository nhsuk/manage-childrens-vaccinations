        flu:
          - The vaccination helps to protect children against flu. It also
            protects others who are vulnerable to flu, such as babies and older
            people.
        hpv:
          - The HPV vaccine helps to prevent HPV related cancers from
            developing in boys and girls.
          - The number of doses you need depends on your age and how well your
            immune system works. Young people usually only need 1 dose.
