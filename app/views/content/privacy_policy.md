Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy covers what personal information we collect, and how we use, share, and store it.

## Who we are

The Manage vaccinations in schools service (Mavis) is run by NHS England for the purpose of managing vaccinations in schools.

## What personal information we collect

When inviting expressions of interest from parents, we collect:

- child’s name
- child’s date of birth
- child’s home address, including postcode
- child’s NHS number (if known)
- previous HPV vaccinations received, if applicable
- parent or guardian’s name
- parent or guardian’s relationship to the child
- parent or guardian’s telephone number
- parent or guardian’s email address

When requesting consent responses from parents and guardians participating in the pilot, we collect personal details of the child, including:

- first name and last name
- school
- date of birth
- home address
- whether the child is registered with a GP, and if yes, the name of the GP surgery

We also collect information relating to consent and the parent/guardian giving that consent, including:

- name of parent/guardian
- relationship to child
- email address
- telephone number
- contact preference (for clarifying any questions regarding consent or answers to the health screening questions)
- whether they agree to the child receiving an HPV vaccine
- if they do not consent, the reason for not agreeing
- the parent’s IP address
- health screening questions that might highlight contraindications to the team administering the vaccinations

During vaccination sessions, we collect the following details for each child:

- date
- time
- location
- location Organisational Data Service (ODS) code
- location Unique Reference Number (URN)
- vaccinator
- whether the child was vaccinated or not, and if not, the reason why

If the child is vaccinated, the following details are captured:

- vaccine
- brand
- manufacturer
- batch
- dose (ml amount)
- dose unit code
- batch expiry date
- manufacturer Product code
- site

When parents taking part in the pilot complete a follow-up survey, we collect the following demographic information:

- location in the UK (broad geographical area)
- age group in broad age bands e.g. 18-30, 31-40, 41-50
- digital literacy
- gender

We also collect data about SAIS teams to allow them to use the service. This includes:

- name
- work email address
- IP address
- professional body
- registration number

Why we collect personal information

- Children’s names are collected so nurses can identify their consent records and report their vaccinations to child health teams

- Children’s addresses are collected to help nurses identify the correct consent record for a child when names are similar

- Children’s dates of birth are used to validate eligibility for the HPV vaccination, and to identify correct consent records when names are similar

- Children’s postcodes are collected to help nurses identify the correct consent record for a child when names are similar

- Parent/guardian names are collected to ensure accurate consent records

- Parent/guardian email addresses are used to communicate the request for consent, a confirmation that consent has been received, reminders to consent and of the upcoming vaccination day, and the outcome of the vaccination session

- Parent/guardian phone numbers are used by nurses to contact parents to get verbal consent and clarify health conditions

- Parent/guardian phone numbers are used by nurses to contact parents to get verbal consent and clarify health conditions

- NHS number is needed to report vaccinations via NIVS (the National Immunisation and Vaccination System)

- Parents or guardians may provide information about relevant medical conditions in response to screening questions. These are used by nurses to determine whether it is safe and appropriate to vaccinate a child.

- Parents or guardians may provide information about their children’s religion or belief in free text areas of the system when refusing a vaccination. This information is not collected as standard, only if the parent/guardian volunteers it.

## How long we store personal information

All data collected will be deleted within two months of the last vaccination session arranged as part of the pilot.

## Where personal information is stored

Data is stored in the United Kingdom. All data held within Manage vaccinations in schools (Mavis) is within the UK jurisdiction, as it is hosted in the ‘Europe (London) region’ on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## How we protect personal information

The Mavis service follows existing best practices and adheres to the [principles set out in the NCSC’s Cloud security guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles). It is deployed to the NHS’s AWS estate, following NHS England’s guidance, and has been penetration tested.

Specific security controls will include but are not limited to:

- **Protection of data in transit.** Use of modern and secure TLS version will be enforced when connecting to the system.

- **Data encryption.** Data will be encrypted before being written to non-volatile storage.

- **Physical location and jurisdiction.** All resources will be created within the “Europe (London) region” to ensure all data and processing happens in the UK.

- **Physical resilience and availability.** The system will have redundancy built-in and regular data backups.

- **Separation between customers.** Role and team-based access controls will be implemented. Session and patient data belong to teams and user access is based on team membership.

- **Vulnerability management.** Automated scanning for old or vulnerable dependencies will be implemented, both at the higher system level and the lower operating-system level.

- **Protective monitoring.** The system will be monitored for errors and malicious behaviour using activity and error logging services.

- **Incident management.** An incident management process will be established and documented before the pilot is started.

- **Configuration and change management.** Changes to the system will go through a peer review before being deployed, include hosting configuration which will be defined as code and version controlled.

- **Secure development.** Changes to the code base will be cryptographically signed. A suite of automated tests will be run for every code change. These include static code analysis to ensure no secrets have been accidentally committed, and that the code follows best practices for security.

## Who the data controllers are

The School Aged Immunisation Service (SAIS) teams taking part in the pilot are the personal data controllers for the information recorded in the Mavis service.

NHS England is the sole controller for the details of parents who have consented to take part in the pilot in relation to providing shopping vouchers as thank-yous.

The SAIS teams are joint controllers with NHS England for the details of parents who have consented to take part in an evaluation of the service.
