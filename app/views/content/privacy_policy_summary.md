Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy covers what personal information we collect, and how we use, share, and store it.

## Who we are

The Manage school-aged vaccinations service (Mavis) is run by NHS England for the purpose of managing vaccinations in schools.

## What personal information we collect

We collect personal details of children eligible for vaccination, including:

- first name and last name
- school
- date of birth
- home address
- whether the child is registered with a GP, and if yes, the name of the GP surgery
- whether or not they received the vaccination
- answers to health screening questions (provided by the parent)

We also collect information relating to consent and the parent/guardian giving that consent, including:

- name of parent/guardian
- relationship to child
- email address
- telephone number
- contact preference (for clarifying any questions regarding consent or answers to the health screening questions)
- whether they agree to the child receiving an HPV vaccine
- if they do not consent, the reason for not agreeing
- IP address
- location in the UK
- age group
- digital literacy
- gender

## Why we collect personal information

We collect personal information so that nurses can:

- identify correct consent records
- validate eligibility for the HPV vaccination
- report vaccinations to child health teams and the National Immunisation and Vaccination System
- send consent requests, reminders and confirmation messages to parents
- check it’s safe to vaccinate a child
- understand a parent’s reasons for refusing to give consent for a vaccination

## How long we store personal information

All data collected will be deleted within two months of the last vaccination session arranged as part of the pilot.

## Where personal information is stored

Data is stored in the United Kingdom.

## How we protect personal information

The service follows existing best practices and adheres to [the principles set out in the NCSC’s Cloud security guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles). It is deployed to the NHS’s AWS estate, following NHS England’s guidance, and has been penetration tested.

## Who the data controllers are

The School Aged Immunisation Service (SAIS) teams taking part in the pilot are the personal data controllers for the information recorded in the Mavis service.

NHS England is the sole controller for the details of parents who have consented to take part in the pilot in relation to providing shopping vouchers as thank-yous.

The SAIS teams are joint controllers with NHS England for the details of parents who have consented to take part in an evaluation of the service.
